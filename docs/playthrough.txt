As you slowly open your eyes, a throbbing ache reverberates through your head
and the acrid scent of chemicals fills the air. Disoriented, you find yourself lying
on a cold metal floor in what appears to be a dimly lit locker room. The flickering
light above casts unsettling shadows on the lockers that surround you.

A soft hum of emergency alarms pulsates through the room, and the distant echoes
of chaotic commotion resonate in the air. Struggling to your feet, you notice a faint
glow emanating from a small screen hanged on the wall near the entrance.
The screen flickers to life, displaying a message in stark white letters: 

"Dr S., the experiment has failed. Containment breach detected. Evacuation
protocol initiated. Escape the facility before critical systems fail. Beware of
anomalies. Your survival is paramount. Time is of the essence.

With a sense of urgency, you realize that your fate is entwined with the impending
collapse of the lab. The clock is ticking, and the path to freedom is uncertain.
Available commands are:

The locker room is dimly lit, with a faint hum of machinery in the air. Rows
of lockers fill the space, closed and orderly. However, one locker catches
your eye - slightly open, a hint of something inside. It seems like the owner
forgot to lock it properly
To the north, a heavy metal door labeled "Security" and a modern keypad next to it present themselves to you
To the east, you see another door with no labels as to where it leads
> inspect locker

A locker for storing personal items. The locker reveals two compartments, in the upper part, a lab coat hangs neatly on a hanger. Below there is another compartment.
> inspect coat

The lab coat stirs a sense of familiarity. The nametag reads: "Dr. J. Sysy.", it triggers a cascade of hazy memories.
As you run your fingers over the fabric, flashes of experiments and research echo in your mind. Memories start coming back to you, it is your coat!
Instinctively you check your pockets. You feel a small, cold object - a *heavy key*. You decide to take it. It might prove useful.
> inventory

Inventory:
- heavy key x1
> inspect compartment

The compartment is locked. Maybe there is a key laying around somewhere?
> inspect keypad

A modern keypad, mounted beside the security room door, stands as the gateway to the lab.
It features a digital touchscreen with a numeric grid and softly backlit keys.
To enter, you must input the correct 6-digit code.
> hint keypad

Use `enter pin <code>` to enter a code
Only 6 digits? That's only like 999 999 options, you can just brute force it...
...or look around for the code, it must be *somewhere*

> unlock east                     

Ok, unlocked.
> go east

You find yourself in a dimly lit corridor, the ambient light casting faint shadows.
Directly ahead to the north, a door labeled "Generator Room" stands prominently.
Looking to the south, the corridor stretches away, its destination obscured by the dim lighting,
The western door leads to the locker room.
> go south

You are further down the corridor, to the west - entrance to the experiment chamber.
The air is heavy with the weight of past scientific endeavors ...or are those toxic fumes?
To the east - a locked door guards more secrets.
> go west

You are in the experiment room. The floor is covered in a sticky, toxic sludge.
On the other side of the room, you see a small metal tool chest.
If you were only able to go through the sludge,
you could see what's inside. The door was blown open by the failure of the experiment, it seems.
The broken door is laying next to where you stand.
> inspect tool chest

Red, metallic tool chest lies across the room. If only you had some protective gear to cross the sludge...
> inspect broken door

You inspect the door closely and decide to flip it over.
What a surprise! Somebody must've put a key into the keyhole.
The key is bent, but it is attached to a keychain, on which there is another key.
What could it unlock?

As you explore the generator room, the dormant generator at the center stands in
stark contrast to the adjacent ventilation shaft. The idle turbines offer a
glimpse into the halted functionality of the lab's power source.
The ventilation shaft on the eastern wall,
though vibrating with a faint breeze, seems large enough for someone to fit through.
> hint vent

If only you had something to open the vent with...
> unlock vent

You slide the crowbar between the vent door and its door frame
and push with a lot of force. The vent swings open!
> inspect generator

The emergency power generator looms with a single glowing cell within, flanked by two conspicuous empty slots,
rendering the machine silent and incomplete, waiting for its missing components.
In order to restore electricity in the lab, the two remaining cells have to be found.
> hint generator

Use `power on generator` to power it on
> power on generator

Power remains elusive without the necessary cells. Find and install them to awaken this dormant machine.
> go east

You are in the vent shaft. You can proceed east, south or west
> go south

As you step into the room bathed in soft light, you notice a solitary desk at
its center. On the desk rests a computer, its screen silent and
dark. The absence of the usual hum of electronic activity adds an eerie calm
to the room, leaving the space seemingly dormant.
To the west there is a locked door. Perhaps it's the one you've seen from the other side in the corridor?.
> inspect desk

The desk in the room is simple yet functional. It holds a powered-off computer
at its center. The smooth surface suggests a place for work or study, while
the surrounding space remains uncluttered, you bend to see what's underneath it
There is a sticky note! It says pass: rot13 XvetvfJnygre
Whats rot13? The computer nerds from the lab wouldn't just leave a password in plain text for everyone to see

The security room is dimly lit, the soft glow of monitors casting a blue hue on
the walls. The air is cool, and the hum of electronic equipment fills the room.
Rows of monitors display surveillance footage, capturing glimpses of different
sections of the lab. The power control switches on the central console beckon,
suggesting a pivotal role in the functionality of the facility.

As you ascend through the elevator, leaving the depths of the lab behind, a sense
of accomplishment washes over you. The familiar hum of the machinery gradually
fades as you reach the surface, greeted by natural light and the open air. The
door opens, revealing a world beyond the confines of the secretive lab. You have
successfully escaped, leaving the mysteries and experiments behind. What lies
ahead is a new chapter, and the journey to freedom is now yours to explore.

The game is over. Thanks for playing!
